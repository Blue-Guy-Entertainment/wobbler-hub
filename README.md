# Wobbler Hub

The official hub for [Wobbler](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2960830/Wobbler/) lives [here, on GitHub](https://github.com/Blue-Guy-Entertainment/wobbler-hub/), where we will organize reports, feedback, and wikis/info.

***STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.***

[Wikis will be primarily maintained on GitHub](https://github.com/Blue-Guy-Entertainment/wobbler-hub/wiki), but will also be synced to the https://blueguyentertainment.com/wobbler/wiki pages (soonâ„¢).

Don't like GitHub? That's understandable. This isn't the only place you can contribute. If you prefer, feel free to choose another of these communities to discuss Wobbler:
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/CatkCx7cvH)
- [Steam Forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2960830/discussions/)

These are the best alternatives we have to directly using GitHub. We will take quality feedback from those platforms, and transfer them to here, where they'll actually be triaged and organized. That said, GitHub is ideal if you're willing to use it; it will be easier to search, track duplicate requests, close discussions about resolved issues, and more. We'll be able to respond and handle your request more quickly.

If you're new to GitHub, but willing to learn it & try it, we encourage you to! The biggest things to keep in mind are:
1. Please try to properly fill out and make use of Issue templates when creating new issues.
2. Suggestions and Issues/Bug Reports both go under the "Issues" tab. It's a bit counter-intuitive, I know. You don't need to worry about any other tabs, except for Wiki.
3. Try to search existing issues for the bug or suggestion you're about to post, to ensure someone else didn't already report the same thing.

It's not a huge deal if you post a duplicate or avoid using the template! We'll still prefer that over having to transfer your suggestion from another platform. Again, if you're not sure, but willing to learn, we encourage you to simply do your best and try using GitHub!
